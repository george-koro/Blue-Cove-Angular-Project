                In the afternoon you will be picked up and driven to the port
                where you will board a private luxury lagoon. This afternoon’s
                cruise combines swimming and snorkeling, dinner on board and
                absorbing firsthand Santorini’s famous sunset!
              </p>
              <p>
                Jump off the catamaran and snorkel around the Red Beach or swim
                at the White Beach, then stop at the famous Hot Springs, where
                parts of the water are warmer due to the active volcano.
